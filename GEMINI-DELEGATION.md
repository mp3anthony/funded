# Delegating to Antigravity (agy)

Set up 2026-09-26 for Ant; kit copied per repo.
**The orchestrator decides when to delegate, per session, without asking Ant.** Ant only reviews when a
result is his to judge (design output, anything visual or taste-driven).

## How
`powershell -NoProfile -File scripts/agy-delegate.ps1 -Task plan|review|design|quick -PromptFile <f> -Files <repo paths>`
- Write the prompt file in the scratchpad, never in the repo.
- agy runs in `D:\Anthonys-HQ\business\hazardous-schematics\agy-workspace\<repo-folder-name>\`, one workspace per
  repo, holding only fresh copies of the named files. agy is given no repo path and is told to stay inside that folder, but
  that is an instruction, not a sandbox: a headless agy cannot be technically walled in, so the file filter (rule 4)
  is the real protection. The script wipes that folder each run (except `outputs\`).
- Every answer is also saved to `agy-workspace\<repo>\outputs\<timestamp>-<task>.md`.
- The cooldown file `agy-workspace\_state.json` is **shared by all repos** on purpose: the Google quota belongs to
  Ant's account, so one repo hitting the limit tells every repo.
- The reusable kit for new repos lives in `D:\Anthonys-HQ\business\hazardous-schematics\agy-delegation-kit\`.

## Which model (routing table lives at the top of the script; edit it there)
| Task | Model | Why |
|---|---|---|
| plan | claude-opus-4-6-thinking | most capable, worth the spend on plans and hard decisions |
| review | gemini-3.8-flash-medium | cheap, good enough for code review, audits, summaries |
| design | gemini-3.1-pro-high | strongest Gemini for briefs, copy, visual direction (orchestrator's pick, untested) |
| quick | gemini-3.8-flash-low | trivial lookups |

## Fallback when Google's limit hits (or agy fails or returns nothing)
- The script exits **3** and prints `AGY_UNAVAILABLE`. For a real quota/outage message it also records a 60-minute
  cooldown in `agy-workspace\_state.json` (shared by all repos) so later calls skip agy without wasting time. A one-off
  failure (bad model name, empty answer, a hang or timeout) exits 3 for that task only and sets **no** cooldown, so
  a repeated hang can cost up to 10 minutes per call: run `-Probe` if delegation keeps failing. Any failed `-Probe`
  (missing agy, bad reply) does set the shared cooldown.
- **On exit 3 the orchestrator does the task itself with Claude subagents** (never blocks on agy, never asks Ant).
- To check whether agy is back: `... agy-delegate.ps1 -Probe` (tiny cheap call; prints `AGY_AVAILABLE` and clears the
  cooldown). Probe at session start if a cooldown is recorded, and whenever a delegation is next worthwhile.
- Untested: a real quota hit (the detector matches quota/rate-limit/429 wording; adjust `$quotaPattern` if the
  real message differs). An empty answer also counts as unavailable.

## Rules
1. **Read-only, text out.** agy edits nothing and runs no commands. The orchestrator applies anything useful.
2. agy's `--print` mode ignores `permissions.allow` (google-antigravity/antigravity-cli#548), so it can't
   approve shell commands headless; it is told to use only its file-read tool inside the workspace.
3. **Never** `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, `--mode accept-edits`, or the gemini-cli MCP.
4. Secrets never go out (exit 4 on refusal): only allowlisted plain source/doc types are copied (`.md .txt .ts .tsx
   .js .jsx .mjs .css .json .html .svg .yml .yaml .ps1 .toml`; images are not sent). Refused: anything under
   `.git`, `.vercel`, `.next`, `.claude`, `node_modules` or `db` (at any depth), a top-level `design/` folder, any path
   containing `.env`, `secret` or `credential`, `.npmrc`, `.mcp.json`, `settings.local`, `id_rsa`, `.pem/.key/.pfx/.p12`
   files, symlinks or junctions on the file or any parent folder, and anything outside the repo. A prompt over 24,000
   characters is also refused (put the bulk in a file). It is a filter, not a guarantee: never name a file you suspect
   holds secrets.
5. **Suited to:** planning, review (agy is the independent reviewer, never the writer of the same code), audits
   against `SPEC.md` Part A guardrails, design and copy ideas, large-context reading.
   **Never:** Git/GitHub, migrations, env, production. Those stay with the orchestrator.
6. **Its output is a claim, not a fact.** Verify before acting; design output is shown to Ant for approval
   before anything ships. Image or asset generation is untested.
7. Prefer delegating when the input is large or the job is read-and-think; skip it for small edits.
